# Hospital-Management-System
Appointment and Doctor Management System
Here, explain the background of the problem.  What is your imaginary business entity is doing for work. 
What kind of a system this entity will have (For example, if we are talking about a system for student registration system for a university, give a brief information about that particular university  and why it makes sense to use a database system for that particular university)

I designed my project as a Java/GUI project in the Hospital management information system style. Considering that digitalization is a very common and developing structure today, keeping the necessary appointment registration information, user information and clinical information in an electronic system will make our work easier.
So in order to solve the problem, I aim to access data (MySql), using a rational database to access information in a secure and orderly manner.
